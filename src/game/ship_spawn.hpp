// Clean-room NPC ship lifecycle primitives. The original keeps all ships in the
// single `g_ship_states` array (64 slots; index 0 = the player) and allocates +
// resets a slot via Ship_AllocateShipSlotInSystem (0x004254b0), then the
// higher-level spawners (Dude_SpawnShipFromDudeDefInSystem,
// EncounterFleet_SpawnShipFromFleetDef, Mission_SpawnShipFrom*) lay a loaded
// ShipClassDef/DudeDef/fleet-def on top of it.
//
// This module reconstructs the allocation primitive against GameState.ships_.
// The deep combat/AI residual fields the original zero-resets here are not yet
// modelled (they only carry weight once the ship AI/combat systems are
// reconstructed); Ship's defaults already match the net zero/-1 reset, and the
// intentional omissions are logged as TODO(decomp) in ship_spawn.cpp.

// resets it to baseline defaults. Returns the allocated slot or -1 when none is
// free (or the reserved tail consumes the whole array).

// PARTIAL reconstruction of the lead-ship spawn of
// EncounterFleet_SpawnRandomEncounterFleet (Ghidra 0x004259b0). Allocates one
// ship slot in system_id for the random-encounter fleet template at
// fleet_def_index (0-based index into ScenarioData.fleets), applying the def's
// lead ship class (if any) and identity: zero-based ship_class_id, government,
// AI behavior
// (or ship-class default when the requested code is -1), base shield/armor,
// mission slots cleared, mining-scoop flag, zero credits. Returns the allocated
// slot
// or -1 when the def has no lead ship, is unavailable at spawn time
// (is_available_runtime clear), or no slot is free.
//
// TODO(decomp) deferred (see ship_spawn.cpp): the original also positions the
// lead (spin-out at a random polar offset via AI state 0x08, or jump-in at an
// adjacent stellar via AI state 0x15), seeds random cargo for carry_cargo_flag
// fleets, copies the 8-bank weapon loadout, and spawns/links the escorts + the
// arrival overlay banner. Those are not yet reconstructed (they sit on the
// deferred AI-state / DudeDef / weapon-bank code); this function leaves the
// ship at a neutral origin heading (ai_state_code 0) so it is visible and
// positioned for rendering but not yet animated or armed.
